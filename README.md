# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the load production risk analysis:
#### Utilize machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting if whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
#### Example 1 - 72.79%, Example 2 - 73.04%, Example 3 - 72.92%, Example 4 - 72.47%

## Summary
#### First example resulted in an accuracy average of 72.79%. All other attempts were within similar range. Conclusion - changing the hidden layers and neurons were ineffective at increasing model accuracy.
